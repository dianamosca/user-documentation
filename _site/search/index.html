						"content": "1. Overview\n\nThis use case explains how to use Unifyd Insights Platform to match Shipment data with VIP Issues. In this scenario, the Unifyd Insight application mirrors data from two systems. First, we use Unifyd Insights to match a VIP Issue with a Shipment record. Then, once a match is made, we update the VIP platform automatically using webhook.\n\n\nTFE - Tutorial from Martin Magdinier on Vimeo.\n\n2. Reviewing Matches\n\n2.1 Navigating to the ML Tasks\n\nTo access the project select Machine Learning &amp; NLP Tasks and then Matching.\n\n\n\n2.2 Using the interface\n\n\n\nIn the view setup the following filter:\n\n  View_Status = Opened\n  Master Record\n  Records with no matches\n\n\nFor each record click the robot icon  to open the lower Matching panel.\n\nIn the lower panel, select only non master records (the grey circle) to display only Shipment data. The Matching algorithm ranks potential matches by scores.\n\nThe matching interface\n\n  Highlight in yellow matching string\n  When two rows match perfectly on the selected field, the application will return a score of 100%. Each difference between the master record and the degrade that score\n\n\nRead more:\n\n  Unifyd Matching Interface (to add)\n\n\n2.3 Searching for Matches\n\nIf the interface does not return a match with a high score, you can search for the entire catalog.\n\n2.4 Webhook\nIf you found a match, click on the green check mark to confirm it. Unifyd will automatically update VIP platform with the following message TFE [Current date in MM/DD format] – Please code to supplier item # [matched supplier item number].  Thank you!\n\nIf there are no matches, you can select one of the following webhook\n\n  Item Not in VIP Item Catalog Yet: TFE [Current date in MM/DD format] – This item is not available for order or shipping yet.  Thank you!\n  Match Not Wanted: Match Not Wanted (discontinued item, another suppliers’ item, etc):  TFE [Current date in MM/DD format] – Please code to 6X.  Thank you!\n  Missing Distributor Item Details: TFE [Current date in MM/DD format] – Please ask distributor to provide product details.  Thank you!\n\n\nWe will notify you by email if the bot to update VIP failed. You can then manually process the update in VIP.\n\n3. Project Set up\n\nThis section describes how we set up the project (one-time configuration). With the following set up the script is idempotent\n\n  if we miss an execution, the following one will reset update the process to mirror VIP and Shipment information\n  if there is an update made outside Unifyd (directly in VIP, for example), Unifyd will reflect those changes at the next update.\n\n\n3.1 Data Pipeline Overview\n\nAn automated script (aka bot) automates the following steps four times per day (at 9 AM, 12 PM, 2 PM, and 7 PM EST).\n\n  Retrieve data from the Shipment and VIP systems and perform advanced data normalization\n  Update data in Unifyd dataset with the following settings\n    \n      One dataset per system\n      No deduplication set up; we update each dataset entirely for two reasons:\n        \n          To ease troubleshooting and data lineage identification. One can review the data coming from each production system as we inserted them in Unifyd\n          We manage the deduplication at the catalog level\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Apply the Wrangle to\n    \n      Convert data type\n      Create the key used in catalog deduplication rules (more details in the next section).\n    \n  \n  Map and Upload in a unique catalog the update to the catalog as described in the following section\n\n\n3.2 Catalog Mapping Configuration\n\nThe catalog mapping is set up with the following parameters:\n\nMaster Records\n\n  Data coming from VIP are imported as Master\n  Data coming from the Shipment are imported as Non Master\n\n\nDeduplication Rules\n\n  Data coming from VIP has the following KEY = ISSUE NUMBER\n  Data coming from the Shipment file has the following KEY = ITEM + DIST ID\n  The mapping use Insert new and replace old data using the KEY field\n\n\n3.3 View Set up\n\nThe current view is configured to review and match open items from VIP rapidly.\n\n  Field orders\n  Field size\n  Hide unnecessary field\n  Filter on Open and Master Record\n\n\nRead more:\n\n  Managing the Grid\n  View Configuration (to add)"

This setting is great if you want to keep a historical version of a records overtime across different updates.\n  Insert Only New Records: If the record has already been uploaded in previous dataset update, it will be discarded from the newest file update. You will see a lower amount of records inserted in Unifyd compare to the total count in your file. New records are inserted.\n  Insert and Update Records: If the record has already been uploaded in previous dataset update, the data in the previous dataset will be updated. In other word we will not keep historical version of a record, the entire dataset only contains the most recent version of each record. The updated record will also be present in the latest dataset update. New records are inserted."

						"content": "1. Introduction\n\nWe use a categorization project to assign records in a catalog to a specific category (for example, product category). Unifyd Insight human in the loop interface mix three approaches to ensure high accuracy of the categorization:\n\n  Rules (created by domain expert)\n  Machine Learning suggestion and categorization.\n  Manual categorization to\n    \n      Assign a record in a category and train the ML model\n      Distribute categorization task across a crowd to review Machine Learning suggestions and resolve conflicts between rules, expert and ML suggestions.\n    \n  \n\n\nUsually, a project is done in three phases (described on this page)\n\n  Project Creation\n  Training the model\n  Running the ML Task and reviewing the results.\n\n\n2. Creating a project\n\nIn this video, we review how to\n\n  Create a new ML Task for Categorization\n  Configure Bootstrap ML Task\n  Create a new categorization structure\n  Manually categorize records\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe review the meaning of each icon in the left menu on the page Review ML and Rule Category Suggestion\n\n3. Training the Model\n\nOnce you created your ML Task project and your category, you can start categorizing! \n\nThe goal is to categorize between at least 100 up to 1,000 items per category to train our ML model. At this stage, we will privilege various patterns for each category (versus looking only for similar records).\n\n\n  Manually: You can manually categorize records in bulk by selecting multiple records and calling the Action &gt; Categorize menu.\n  Using Rules: If you want to automatically categorize all records matching a set of filters, you can create a rule. With the Auto Label Record option, the records will be assigned to the right category. Learn more about rules creation and management\n  Unifyd bootstrapped Machine Learning engine will start suggesting categories as you categorize items. Those categories are generated on the fly and are updated as you progress in your categorization.\n  The Rules Conflict Ambiguity Chart presents where rules and manual categorization by an expert conflict help to focus on attention.\n\n\nNote: If you have a similar dataset already categorized, we can leverage them as examples in the Unifyd engine. Contact us for more details.\n\n4. Running the ML Task\n\nOnce the model is trained, we can configure a batch ML Categorization. In this process we:\n\n  Configure the model (please get in touch with your service team for this step)\n  Train the model on your dataset and batch categorize records. This task can take from few minutes to several hours, depending on the size of your dataset\n  Review the conflict between ML suggestion and your rules and expert categorization. The ambiguity chart helps to target hard-to-categorize items and improve the model accuracy.\n  Build, train and rerun a new model. We usually need a couple of iteration to achieve up to 99% accuracy of the model."

Once created, the view is accessible from the Catalog and all related ML Tasks. All Catalog Table comes with a default public view which is shared with all users.\n\nKnown Limitations: The view is automatically updated as you make changes to the grid parameters and filter option. This can lead to two known side effects:\n\n  You cannot restore a view to a previous state. You will need to reconfigure it manually\n  Since the default view is shared with all users, filter from one user will impact others. To avoid conflicts, we recommend each user create a private default view (see section 3. Recommended Settings below).\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Creating View\n\n\n  Create New View: You will reset all parameters from your current view and start from a blank slate\n  Copy View: You will start the view with the same configuration as the current view you are in.\n\n\nWhen creating a view, select if the view is:\n\n  Public: shared with others users who have access to the catalog or ML Task.\n  Default: You can have only one default view. It will be displayed when you login into Unifyd. Note that if you changed view during your session, the latest loaded view will be used when accessing the catalog table (or any ML task) again.\n\n\n3. Recommended settings\n\n\n  Default View At the Catalog Table creation, configure the default view as a template for other users to create their personal view. Update column size and order, row height, display images when needed, hide un-relevant columns.\n  Personal View Using Copy View, ask each new user to create a Default Private view (i.e., non-public)\n  Download View If you are using a script to download data regularly from the catalog, you can create a dedicated private view) to manage your export format."
