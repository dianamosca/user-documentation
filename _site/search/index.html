We use Unifyd Insights to perform identify Shipment records matching a VIP Issue. Once the match perform, the data is automatically pushed using webhook into the operation system.\n\nProject Set up\n\nThis section describes how we set up the project (one time configuration). With the following set up the script is idempotent\n\n  if we miss an execution, the following one will reset update the process to mirror VIP and Shipment information\n  if there is update made outside Unifyd (directly in VIP for example), Unifyd will reflect those changes at the next update.\n\n\nData Pipeline Overview\n\nA automated script (aka bot) automates the following steps four times per day (at 9AM, 12PM, 2PM and 7PM EST).\n\n  Retrive data from the Shipment and VIP systems and perform advanced data normalization\n  Update data in Unifyd dataset with the following settings\n    \n      One dataset per system\n      No deduplication set up, we update each dataset in full for two reasons\n        \n          Ease troubleshooting and data lineage identification. One can review the data as they were inserted in Unifyd\n          We manage the deduplication at the catalog level\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Apply the Wrangle to\n    \n      Convert data type\n      Create the key used in catalog deduplication rules (see following section).\n    \n  \n  Map and Upload in a commom catalog the update to the catatalog as described in the following section\n\n\nCatalog Mapping Configuration\n\nThe catalog mapping is set up with the following parameters:\n\nMaster Records\n\n  Data coming from VIP are imported as Master\n  Data coming from the Shipment are imported as Non Master\n\n\nDeduplication Rules\n\n  Data coming from VIP has the following KEY = ISSUE NUMBER\n  Data coming from the Shipment file has the following KEY = ITEM + DIST IT\n  The mapping use Insert new and replace old data using the KEY field\n\n\nView Set up\n\nThe current view is configured with optimized\n\n  Field orders\n  Field size\n  Hide unecessary field\n  Filter on Open and Master Record\n\n\nRead more:\n\n  Managing the Grid\n  View Configuration (to add)\n\n\nReviewing Matches\n\nUsing the interface\n\n\n\nIn the view setup the following filter:\n\n  View_Status = Opened\n  Master Record\n  Records with no matches\n\n\nFor each record click the robot icon  to open the lower Matching panel.\n\nIn the lower panel select only non master records (the grey circle) to display only Shipment data. The Matching algorythme ranks potential matches by scores.\n\nThe matching interface\n\n  Highlight in yellow matching string\n  When two rows matches perfectly on the selected field the application will return a score of 100%. Each difference between the master record and the degrade that score\n\n\nRead more:\n\n  Unifyd Matching Interface (to add)\n\n\nSearching for Matches\n\nIf the interface does not return a match with a high score you can search for the entire catalog.\n\nWebhook\nIf you found a match, click on the green check mark to confirm it. Unifyd will automaticall update VIP platform with the following message TFE [Current date in MM/DD format] – Please code to supplier item # [matched supplier item number].  Thank you!\n\nIf there is no matches you can select one of the following webhook\n\n  Item Not in VIP Item Catalog Yet: TFE [Current date in MM/DD format] – This item is not available for order or shipping  yet.  Thank you!\n  Match Not Wanted: Match Not Wanted (discontinued item, another suppliers’ item, etc):  TFE [Current date in MM/DD format] – Please code to 6X.  Thank you!\n  Missing Distributor Item Details: TFE [Current date in MM/DD format] – Please ask distributor to provide product details.  Thank you!\n\n\nWe will notify you by email if the bot to update VIP failed. You can then manually process the update in VIP."

In our tutorial we only use the filter contains on a single column.\n\nUsing the rules-task-template.xlsx template (line 2 and 3 are available as example, you can delete them):\n\n  name:  Name of the rule as it will appear in Unifyd Interface\n  output: Name of the category it should be mapped to. You need to provide the full path of the category. We recommend that you copy the value from the Unifyd interface.\n  filters: do not edit this column The Excel formula concatenante the value from column D to G to generate the filter expression for Unifyd. The formula is\n    =\"{\"\"\"&amp;D2&amp;\"\"\"\"&amp;\":{\"&amp;\"\"\"\"&amp;\"operand\"\"\"&amp;\":[\"\"\"&amp;F2&amp;\"\"\"\"&amp;\",\"&amp;\"\"\"\"&amp;G2&amp;\"\"\"\"&amp;\",\"\"\"&amp;\"0\"\"\"&amp;\",\"\"\"&amp;\"0\"\"\"&amp;\"],\"\"\"&amp;\"operator\"\"\"&amp;\":\"\"\"&amp;E2&amp;\"\"\"\"&amp;\"}}\"\n    \n    Update the following columns to generate the filters expression\n  \n  Data Column Used: Which column is used for filtering. It should match the column name in Unifyd.\n  Filter Type: in this tutorial we only use CONTAINS (in UpperCase only)\n  Filter Variable: the keyword to search. It can contains only one and only one keyword. Unifyd do not support array or list of search at this point, you will need to create one filter for each value\n  But Not Variable: the keyword to exclude from the search. It can contains only one and only one keyword. Unifyd do not support array or list of search at this point.\n\n\nOnce your rules generated, you can copy and use paste special without the formula (using Ctrl+Alt+V see Office documentation) the columns name output filters to the rules-task-template.csv document and save it as csv."
