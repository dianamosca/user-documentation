As you start labelling records, Unifyd Insights Machine Learning will automatically starts suggesting category for similar records. The suggestion improve as more example are provided. Depending of your dataset (size and number of category), we suggest a threshold of a few hundreds to a thousand categorized rows per category for the ML to produce good recommendation. 

Please note:
* ML are only suggestion. You will need to manually review and approve them by upvoting them.
* If the selected catory is wrong, you can  down vote it to select the next suggested category. 
* At any time you can bulk upvote or downvote item from the `Action` menu.
* Once categorize the `Labels` will show the classified icon" <img src="/user-documentation/images/sitemap-solid.svg" width="25" height="25">
