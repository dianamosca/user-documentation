In this tutorial we walk through the contains filter on a catalogue including usage of
* `All Of`  to search all word separated by comma (AND search)
* `Any Of` to search any word separated by comma (OR search)
* Build complex search by combining multiple string with `AND` / `OR` / `BUT NOT` operators
* Use Case Sensitive either for a specific word 

**Known limitations**
* When using a list of comma separated words, make sure you have no space between your term.
* You need to use Case Sensitive search to for multiple word ([UNPR-1103](https://unifyd.atlassian.net/browse/UNPR-1103))
* Note that at this stage you cannot search string that contains a comma `,` ([UNPR-1092](https://unifyd.atlassian.net/browse/UNPR-1092))
